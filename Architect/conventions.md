## Naming Conventions

### Files & Folders

- [Define your file and folder naming standards]
- [e.g., PascalCase, camelCase, kebab-case, snake_case]
- [e.g., One type per file, or grouping strategy]

### Types (Classes, Structs, Enums, Protocols)

- [Define naming conventions for different type categories]
- [e.g., PascalCase for types, specific suffixes for protocols]
- [e.g., Naming patterns for specific roles like ViewModels, Services, etc.]

### Variables & Constants

- [Define naming conventions for variables and constants]
- [e.g., camelCase, boolean naming patterns]
- [e.g., Constants naming approach]

### Functions & Methods

- [Define function and method naming conventions]
- [e.g., Verb-first naming, parameter clarity guidelines]

## Code Style

### Formatting

- Indentation: [e.g., 2 spaces, 4 spaces, tabs]
- Max line length: [e.g., 80, 100, 120 characters]
- Brace style: [e.g., same line, new line]
- [Other formatting rules]

## Patterns & Practices

### Architecture Pattern

[Describe your chosen architecture pattern and its implementation rules]

| Component     | Responsibility                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| [Component 1] | [What it does and doesn't do] |
| [Component 2] | [What it does and doesn't do] |
| [Component 3] | [What it does and doesn't do] |

**Rules:**

1. [Rule 1 about component interactions]
2. [Rule 2 about dependencies]
3. [Rule 3 about data flow]
4. [Additional architectural rules]

### Data Models

- [How data models are organized and where they live]
- [Naming and responsibility guidelines]
- [Persistence considerations]

### Error Handling

- [Error handling strategy and patterns]
- [How errors are propagated and displayed]
- [Logging requirements]

### Dependency Injection

- [Dependency injection approach]
- [When and how to inject dependencies]
- [Service locator policy]

### Concurrency

- [Concurrency model and patterns]
- [Thread safety guidelines]
- [Async/await or callback patterns]
